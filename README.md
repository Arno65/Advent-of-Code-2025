# Advent-of-Code-2025

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2025.\
My main programming language is Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.\
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2025 account.

Day 1 to 12 all have solutions in Haskell.\
Day 1 to 4 also have solutions in Clojure. (Just for the fun of it and learning this language.)\
Day 11 also has a solution in Swift. The Swift version is the quicker one and uses less RAM.

I've also worked on the Infi challenge. (In Dutch... [Infi AoC](https://aoc.infi.nl/2025) )

Happy coding!
