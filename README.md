# Advent-of-Code-2025

This repository contains most of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2025.\
My main programming language is Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.\
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2025 account.

Day 1 and 2 have solutions in Haskell.



W.i.p.:\
I'm also working on the Infi challenge. (https://aoc.infi.nl/2025)


Happy coding!
